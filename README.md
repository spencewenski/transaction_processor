# Transaction Processor

This a Rust CLI program to transform transaction records of various financial
accounts to different formats. This is intended to help with importing bank and
credit card statements into a spreadsheet or other budget system. The program
is fairly flexible; it can support many different statement formats just by
modifying the configuration file provided at run time.
